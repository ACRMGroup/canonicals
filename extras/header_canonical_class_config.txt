! Each class is defined with the keyword LOOP followed by the loop ID,
! class name and length. This is then followed by the key residue numbers
! paired with the allowed amino acid types.
! Blank lines and lines starting with a ! or # are ignored
! The SOURCE keyword may follow the LOOP keyword, but is ignored by
! KabatMan.
!
! Note that the lengths of the loops are as defined by AbM since the
! Kabat numbering for H1 fails to place the inserted residues within
! the Chothia loop...
!
! This indicates that the numbering used is Chothia numbering not Kabat
! numbering. This keyword is only understood from KabatMan V2.16, so
! don't use this file with earlier versions!!
