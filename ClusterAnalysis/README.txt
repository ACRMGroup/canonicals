clusterList.pl and multiOnList.sh are both written in order to analyze structures in each cluster.

clusterList.pl takes clan_out file and generates lists that include name for each cluster. For example, if there are 100 clusters listed in the clan_out file, clusterList.pl will generate 100 lists where the first list has all the names of the structures in the cluster 1, and so on.

multiOnList.sh takes three inputs. The first is the total number of clusters where the user manually gives when running the program. The second input is the list files generated by clusterList.pl, and the thrid input is the pdb files of the structures. This program aligns structures in the same cluster by using ProFit and creates a pdb file for each cluster. Each generated pdb file is a representation of the corresponding cluster.

The following is the steps required to use the programs:

1. Move clusterList.pl and multiOnList.sh to the NR_CombinedAb_Chothia directory where all the pdb files for the antibody structures exist.

2. Run clusterList.pl to generate lists. Make a note on how many lists it creates.

3. Run mutiOnList.sh and give the total number of lists created.

4. Now *.chain.pdb files are created and ready for further analysis.

*clusterList.pl and multiOnList.sh in this directory is for L1 loop, and a slight modification is needed in order to use it for other loops. You can find the modified versions of the programs in subdirectories. 

In the 'pdb files' directory, there are subdirectories for each loop (H1, H2, L1, L2, L3). Each of the subdirectory contains pdb files, lists, and modified versions of the programs. The first cluster for all of the loops is put into a separate directory because the first clusters are too big to apply pdbchain program. As a result, the first cluster is divided into subclusters and then combined later on.
