Examination of structures belonging to class 7C of CDR-L2.

What all to check:

1) Complexation with antigen.
2) Whether the loop makes contacts with other chains.
3) Re-check for temperature factors in the loop.


1nc2 - Not complexed, no contacts with other chains in the unit cell.
	Antibody 2d12.5.

1nc4 - Not complexed, no contacts with other chains in the unit cell.
	Antibody 2d12.5
       Analyzed structure of 1nc4 fitted to 1dbb. The flip in conformation is
       at the same place in CDR-L2 as in 3i9g (i.e. at L51). 1nc4 has an ASN at L51
       which is pointing towards the surface.

1i8i - Complexed with a small peptide antigen of EGFR. The light chain does
not make any specific contacts with antigen. High temperature factor around
P@L56.

Analyzed structure of 1i8i fitted to 1dbb. The main deviation in CDR-L2 is at
L51 (GLY@L51 in 1i8i). Similar to the structure 3i9g.

1i8i - 7C
1dbb - 7A

3i9g - Compared 3i9g (median structure of 7C) with 1dbb (median structure of
7A). In 1dbb, V@L51 seems to be making Hydrophobic contacts with L@L33. The main switch
in conformation in CDR-L2 is at L51. The residue at L51 in 3i9g is a GLY is
pointing towards the surface whereas the V@L51 in 1dbb is pointing towards the
core of the light chain.

3i9g - 7C
1dbb - 7A

1i8k - The same as 1i8i.

Structural analysis of the following structures:

1dbb: 7A
1nc4: 7C
1i8i: 7C
3i9g: 7C

A fit over CDR-L2 of the light chains of the above structures shows that
the main flip in the CDR-L2 conformation occurs at L51. The residues at
L51 are as follows:

1dbb: V@L51
1nc4: N@L51
1i8i: G@L51
3i9g: G@L51

V@L51 in 1dbb is pointing towards the core of the light chain whereas the side
chains of the other residues are pointing towards the surface.
