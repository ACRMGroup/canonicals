Steps involved:

1) Get a list of all PDBs and their mappings to canonical classes.

2) For every canonical class:

   --> Gather a list of SDRs
   --> Find critical residues in every structure assigned to that canonical class.
   --> All SDRs where a gap has been observed in at least one structure should be recorded.
