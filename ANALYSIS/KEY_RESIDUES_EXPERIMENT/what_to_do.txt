1) Let's assume a set of 100 unique abs - X.

2) Let's say for CDR-L1 (using CDR-L1 as an example), the following definitions apply:

   a) c is CDR-L1 sequence.
   b) k is the set of key residues in the CDR for the specific class of CDR-L1.
   c) f is the set of key residues in the framework for the class of CDR-L1.

3) For each x in X, do the following steps:

4) Define X' as (X - x).

5) For each x' in X':

6) If the length of the CDR of x' is not the same as x, go to the next sequence.

7) Performing the following steps:

   Case I)

   a) Calculate the sequence identity of x,x' over c.

   b) Record the best PDB b.

   c) Calculate the RMS over the the loop between b and x.


   Case II)

   a) Calculate the sequence identity of x,x' over k + f.

   b) Record the best PDB b.

   c) Calculate the RMS over the the loop between b and x.


   Case III)

   a) Calculate the sequence identity of x,x' over k + f.

   b) Record ALL the best PDBs b - set B.

   c) Calculate the sequence identity over (f + c) between every b (in B) and x.

   c) For the best b in step (c), calculate the RMSD with x over the loop.


Finally, a table that collates the outcome of the above experiments with the
following information:

1) Query PDB
2) Best match in loop sequence: PDB
3) RMSD with Step (2).
4) Best match in key residues: PDB.
5) RMSD with step (3).
6) Best match in loop + key residues: PDB
7) RMSD with step (6).
