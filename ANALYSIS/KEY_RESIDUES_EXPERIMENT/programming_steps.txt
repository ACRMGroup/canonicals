1) Requirements in terms of files:

   a) Canonical class definitions file with key residues in FASTA format:

      >L1:16A
      L26:L32....

   b) Numbering files.

   c) Loop definition.

2) Steps:

      a) Get a list of unique Fvs.

      b) Identify c (CDR sequence), k (key residues in CDR), f (key residues in framework).

      c) A program that takes an alignment and returns the pairwise sequence identity.
