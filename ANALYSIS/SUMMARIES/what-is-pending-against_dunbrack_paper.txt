In the light of the Dunbrack paper, the following aspects need investigation (Notes, discussions and aspects that need addressing):

1) What is the structural variability in CDRs with identical sequences.

2) High B-factors - anything more than 50 should be regarded as being high.

3) Paper says all 10-residue CDR-L1s are mouse kappa. IMGT has 83 human 10-residue sequences. 2zkh is a human antibody that has a 10-residue CDR-L1.

4) Type III - Check if we can distinguish type III classes of the paper on the basis of SDRs.

5) By moving away from Chothia's definition of canonical classes, they appear to be losing accuracy (accuracy around 88-96%).
   Do we do 100% with SDR definitions?

6) Investigate the number of classes for CDR-H1 in the paper.

7) CDR-H2 important. Look out for the bit about H71 not being predictive. Are there other SDRs that
   we can define to predict the canonical class.

8) Changes in classes of the loops from the previous analysis.

9) Some clusters got bigger from Andrew's previous analysis? The paper says that some crystal structures in Andrew's analysis
   are poor quality and form singleton classes. The question now is do any of those previous clusters belong to larger
   classes now and if they do, are there high resolution structures in those classes?
