19 January 2011: Chat with Andrew
---------------------------------

Discussions on the next steps required:

1) For every canonical class, identify SDRs that might have gaps in some structures.
   Add gaps to the list of permissible residues to the canonical definitions life.

2) Extend the canonicals assignment program so that the (OR) rules for the canonical classes
   with clashes.

3) Gather sequences of publicly available antibodies and their sources from Abysis.

4) Assess percentage of sequences in the public domain that can be assigned a canonical class
   on the basis of SDRs accurately.

5) Gather data to see distribution of number of canonical classes to length of loop.

6) Write a paper describing the results.
